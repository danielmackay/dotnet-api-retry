> Based off of Nick Chapsas's Youtube [video](https://youtu.be/nJH0PC2Pubs)

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

Simple Web API that returns Star Wars People from an external API.  `IHttpClientFactory` and `Polly` have been used to implement a transient retry policy.

The policy works as follows:

- Triggered via
  - `HttpRequestException` being thrown
  - HTTP 5XX being returned
  - Http 408 (request timeout) being returned
- Retries
  - Retry 5 times
  - Exponential backoff with jitter between retries

## âš¡ Getting Started

- `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch run`
- Browser will launch and navigate to <https://localhost:7128/swagger/index.html>
